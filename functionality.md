# Description:
Hospitals face challenges in managing large volumes of patient data, appointments,
billing, and communication efficiently. Manual processes can lead to errors, delays, and
loss of critical information, negatively impacting patient care and operational efficiency.
The Hospital Management System (HMS) aims to solve these issues by providing a
centralized platform to manage patient records, schedule appointments, generate bills,
and facilitate communication between staff, doctors, and patients. This system will
ensure data accuracy, reduce manual workload, and improve the overall hospital
experience.
